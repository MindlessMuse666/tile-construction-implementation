On this scene I implemented the mechanics of building with tiles. 
In front of you is a map of size [10x10]. In the upper left corner of the screen there are buttons with types of tiles. 

1. The player can place tiles on a level within a designated grid. 
2. When a tile can be placed on the surface it is highlighted in green, if a tile cannot be placed it is highlighted in red.
3. the tiles move on the cells of the invisible grid even outside the marked field.
